  "description": "FrostFlake is a canvas-rendering game engine written in JavaScript ES6. I originally started FrostFlake in 2014 as a way to have fun while learning the deeper aspects of JavaScript. The goal was to build a simple game engine with the fewest dependencies possible. I rewrote the engine in TypeScript in 2017, and again in ES6 in 2020.",
